    <h1> Implementing unbounded nonblocking channels in Go </h1>
    <p>It would have been nice if it was possible to create nonblocking channels in Go with dynamic capacity. At work, I needed a data structure to solve the classic producer/consumer problem - with the following constraints: </p>
<ol>
<li>The number of consumers and producers were not known ahead of time</li>
<li>The consumers should stop waiting once the producers are finsihed</li>
<li>The producers should not be blocked if the consumers are not able to keep up </li>
</ol>
<p>It the second constraint that made the problem harder - otherwise a simple global buffer protected by locks would've sufficied. </p>
<p>It is not possible to solve this with channels in Go because to have non-blocking channels you'd need to know the capacity of the channel. So I implemented a data structure which can act as a nonblocking channel with dynamic capacity. This data structure follows some semantics similar to a Go channel:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Receive</code> blocks till data is available</li>
<li>A <code>Close</code> on it will send a signal to all waiting consumers</li>
<li>A <code>Send</code> on a closed channel will panic</li>
</ol>
<p>It differs in the following semantics:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Send</code> will always suceed - dynamic capacity</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is this: have a global buffer that consumers and producers can access, protected by a lock. But we do not use this lock directly - we wrap it in a condition variable. A condition variable provides an additional important functionality necessary to satisfy the second constraint: a way to signal (i.e wake up) consumers waiting (i.e sleeping) on the condition variable.</p>
<p>This signal can be of 2 types:
1. Send the signal to a single waiting consumer
2. Broadcast the signal to all the waiting consumers</p>
<p>A condition variable is used to signal that some condition has been met between threads. It exposes two functionalities: to sleep on the variable and to broadcast on the variable (which wakes up any sleeping threads). </p>
<p>Condition variables in Go have the both the ability to <code>Signal</code> and <code>Broadcast</code>.</p>
<p>The idea is that any thread that needs to wait for a condition to be met can sleep on on condition variable. This is much more efficient than continuosly checking it in a for loop. Any other thread that causes this condition to be met can wake up the sleeping threads (if any) using the same condition variable. </p>
<p>The psuedocode for producer would look like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">    1. Acquire lock
    2. Add to buffer
    3. If buffer was empty - signal on the condition variable to wake up one sleeping
        (if any) consumers
    4. Release lock
</code></pre>
<p>The psuedocode for consumer would look like: </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">    1. Acquire lock via condition variable
    2. if buffer empty:
        wait on condition variable
    3. consume from the buffer
    4. release lock
</code></pre>
<p>This data structure will also provide a <code>Close</code> method to <code>broadcast</code> to all the sleeping consumers and tell them that no more data will be available. Let's look at the implementation now: </p>
<p>The Go struct would be: </p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type UnboundedChannel[T any] struct {
    buffer      []T
    bufCondVar *sync.Cond
    closed      bool
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>closed</code> will be used to check if the channel is closed or not before sending or receiving -
if closed send will panic and receive will return any items remaining in buffer or a zero value.</p>
<p>The actual implementation of the <code>Send</code> function (i.e producer)</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (uc *UnboundedChannel[T]) Send(data T) {
    uc.bufCondVar.L.Lock()
    defer uc.bufCondVar.L.Unlock()

    if uc.closed {
        panic(&quot;sending on a closed channel&quot;)
    }

    uc.buffer = append(uc.buffer, data)
    if len(uc.buffer) == 1 {
        uc.bufCondVar.Signal()
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>As in the pseudocode, we first acquire the lock. The case of sending on closed channel was 
not covered in the pseudocode - I wanted to keep that simple and focus on the main concept.
If the buffer was empty, we will <code>Signal</code> on the condition variable to wake up one sleeping consumer.</p>
<p>Sending a <code>Signal</code> here instead of <code>Broadcasting</code> is very important and subtle: in the 
<code>Receive</code>, we wait for the condition to be true in a <code>if</code>. If producer was <code>Broadcasting</code>
instead of <code>Signalling</code>, we'd now need to sleep in a <code>for</code> loop: because all the waiting 
consumers get awoken at the same time, they cannot be sure that the condition is true</p>
<p>The implementation of <code>Receive</code> function (i.e consumer)</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (uc *UnboundedChannel[T]) Receive() (T, bool) {
    uc.bufCondVar.L.Lock()
    defer uc.bufCondVar.L.Unlock()

    if uc.closed {
        var zero T
        return zero, false
    }
    if len(uc.buffer) == 0 {
        uc.bufCondVar.Wait()
        if uc.closed {
            var zero T
            return zero, false
        }
    }

    data := uc.buffer[len(uc.buffer)-1]
    uc.buffer = uc.buffer[:len(uc.buffer)-1]
    return data, true
}
</code></pre>
<p>The logic here is: after getting the lock, if it has been closed, return a zero value. 
Otherwise, <code>Wait</code> for condition to be true: i.e buffer to be not-empty. But when the 
<code>Receive</code> gets awoken, it cannot be sure if it is because <code>Close</code> was called or <code>Send</code> 
was called. Therefore, we again check if <code>Close</code> has been called and if it has, we return
the zero value again.</p>
<p>Another thing to note here is that <code>Receive</code> returns a boolean which tells whether the data
was returned from the buffer or a zero value was returned. If a zero value was returned, the 
consumers can assume that the channel was closed.</p>
<p>The remaining part is as explained in the pseudocode.</p>
<p>Finally, we can have one more <code>Close</code> function, which can be used to tell the consumers that
no more data will be sent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (uc *UnboundedChannel[T]) Close() {
    uc.bufCondVar.L.Lock()
    defer uc.bufCondVar.L.Unlock()
    uc.closed = true
    uc.bufCondVar.Broadcast()
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can panic here if needed - that would maintain similar semantics with a Go channel. </p>
<p>And that's it! Here's a simple test to make sure it works and show it's usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func Test_UnboundedChannel(t *testing.T) {
    uc := NewUnboundedChannel[int]()
    array := make([]int, 10)
    wg := sync.WaitGroup{}

    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            indx, _ := uc.Receive()
            array[indx] = 1
        }()
    }

    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(i int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            uc.Send(i)
        }(i)
    }

    wg.Wait()

    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        if array[i] != 1 {
            t.Fatalf(&quot;unbounded channel not working&quot;)
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>This just creates 10 consumers and 10 producers and send a unique value from 
the producers and is verified that all the consumers have all the unique values.</p>
